URL shortening is a technique used on the internet to turn an HTTP address into a shorter link. The shortening of URL gained prominence on the internet with the popularization of Twitter, in which users had a limit of 140 characters for their posts. Thus, saving characters with a URL shortener allowed to transmit more information per tweet. In addition, shortened links are more pleasant to read, making the text that contains the link cleaner and more readable.
